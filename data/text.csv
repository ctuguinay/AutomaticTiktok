Alice's screams turned into choked gurgles as the ants crawled into her mouth and nostrils, devouring her from the inside out. She thrashed and convulsed, but it was no use.

The ants retreated back into their colony, sated for now but always on the lookout for their next victim.",false

As they approached the island, they noticed that the treasure was guarded by a group of fierce dogs. But the pirate cats were not ones to be deterred by a little danger. They quickly hatched a clever plan to distract the guards, while they sneaked past and made their way to the treasure.

The cats crept through the jungle, their paws silent on the soft ground. They finally reached the place where the treasure was hidden, deep in the heart of the island.",true
"Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a group of cats who loved to sail the seas. They were not your typical cats, but rather pirate cats, with a thirst for adventure and treasure.

These cats sailed the seas, feasting on fish and drinking rum, while searching for lost treasures and other valuable booty. They were led by Captain Whiskers, a fierce tabby with a sharp mind and a quick paw.

One day, as they were sailing along the coast, they spotted a small island in the distance. There, they could see a mysterious treasure chest guarded by a group of monkeys.

Captain Whiskers immediately ordered his crew to steer towards the island, and soon they were upon it. The monkeys were quick, but the pirate cats were quicker, and they soon had the treasure chest in their possession.

But as they opened it up, they were shocked to find that it was not filled with gold and jewels, but with a map to a hidden",true

"It started with a single ant bite. Alice didn't think much of it at first, just a minor annoyance. But soon, the bite began to fester and swell, and she noticed more and more ants crawling on her skin. Alice tried to brush them off, but they only grew more aggressive. They swarmed her, covering her body in a writhing mass of black and red. She screamed for help, but it was too late. The ants had already begun to eat her flesh. Alice's screams turned into choked gurgles as the ants crawled into her mouth and nostrils, devouring her from the inside out. She thrashed and convulsed, but it was no use. The ants were too many, too hungry. When they were finished, all that was left was a pile of bones and a few shreds of clothing. The ants retreated back into their colony, sated for now but always on the lookout for their next victim.",false
"In a faraway land, there lived a group of cats who loved to play pranks on each other. One day, they decided to have a race to see who was the fastest. They lined up at the starting line, but as soon as the race began, they all scampered off in different directions. Some ran in circles, others chased their tails, and one even climbed up a tree. They were all so silly that they forgot they were supposed to be racing. The winner was the cat who sat at the finish line, watching with a satisfied smirk, knowing they had outsmarted the other cats with their silly ways.",true
